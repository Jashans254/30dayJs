/*Day 2: Operators
Tasks/Activities:
By the end of these activities, students will:
• Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
• Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
• Compare values using comparison operators.
• Combine conditions using logical operators.
• Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
*/

// Tasks/Activities:
// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
// • Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
const num1 = 2;
const num2 = 4;
console.log(num1 + num2)

// • Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
const num3 = 20;
const num4 = 4;
console.log(num1 - num2)

// • Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
const num5 = 2;
const num6 = 4;
console.log(num1 * num2)

// • Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
const num7 = 20;
const num8 = 4;
console.log(num1 / num2)

// • Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
const num9 = 20;
const num10 = 4;
console.log(num1 % num2)

// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
// • Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
let num11 = 2;
num11 += 4;
console.log(num11)

// • Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
let num12 = 20;
num12 -= 4;
console.log(num12)

// Activity 3: Comparison Operators
// • Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using › and ‹ and log the result to the console.
const num13 = 2;
const num14 = 4;
console.log(num13 > num14)
console.log(num13 < num14)  

// • Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and ‹= and log the result to the console.
const num15 = 2;
const num16 = 4;
console.log(num13 >= num14)
console.log(num13 <= num14)

// • Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
const num17 = 2;
const num18 = 4;
console.log(num13 == num14)
console.log(num13 === num14)

// Activity 4: Logical Operators
// • Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
const num19 = 2;
const num20 = 4;
console.log(num13 > num14 && num13 < num14)

// • Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
const num21 = 2;
const num22 = 4;
console.log(num13 > num14 || num13 < num14)

// • Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
const num23 = 2;
const num24 = 4;
console.log(!(num13 > num14))

// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
// • Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
const num25 = 2;
console.log(num25 >0 ? "Positive" : "Negative")

// Feature Request:
// 1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on
// two numbers and logs the results.
const N1 = 34
const N2 = 23
console.log("Addition: ", N1 + N2)
console.log( "subtraction: ",N1 - N2)
console.log(  "division: ",N1 / N2)
console.log("Multiplication: ",N1 * N2)
console.log( "remainder: ",N1 % N2)
// 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.

const cpm1 = 45
const cpm2 = 30

console.log(cpm1 > cpm2 && cpm1 < cpm2);
